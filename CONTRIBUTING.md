# Contributing to this repository

This project is not actively seeking external contributions. If you raise an issue or open a pull request, we will do our best to respond to it, but we can’t guarantee that we will fix or merge anything.

If you’re thinking about putting a lot of work into a pull request, and would like to get a better idea of whether we’d consider merging it, we advise that you first open a GitHub issue so that we can talk about it.
