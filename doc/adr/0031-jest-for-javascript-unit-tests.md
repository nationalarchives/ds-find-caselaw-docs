# 31. Jest for JavaScript Unit Tests

**Date:** 2025-02-07
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

### Background

The Find Case Law website includes various JavaScript functions that provide interactive features to users.

### Problem

- These JavaScript functions currently lack automated tests.
- The code is complex enough that making changes without causing unintended issues is difficult.
- There is no existing framework to ensure JavaScript functions behave as expected.

### Goals

- Implement automated unit tests for JavaScript functions.
- Enable developers to modify JavaScript code confidently without introducing regressions.
- Use a well-supported and widely adopted testing framework that is easy to learn and integrate.

## Options Considered

1. **Mocha** – A flexible testing framework but requires additional setup for assertions, mocks, and spies.
2. **Jest** – A widely adopted testing framework with built-in support for assertions, mocking, and coverage reporting.
3. **Jasmine** – A mature framework but less commonly used in modern JavaScript projects compared to Jest.

## Decision

### Solution

Use **Jest** as the JavaScript unit testing framework.

### Justification

- Jest is the most widely adopted JavaScript testing framework, making it easy for developers to learn and use.
- Provides built-in support for assertions, mocking, and code coverage, reducing setup complexity.
- Actively maintained with strong community support.
- Well-integrated with modern JavaScript tooling and frameworks.

## Consequences

- JavaScript functions will have automated unit tests, improving reliability and maintainability.
- Developers can modify JavaScript code with greater confidence, reducing the risk of regressions.
- Writing new JavaScript code will be more structured, as testability becomes a standard practice.
