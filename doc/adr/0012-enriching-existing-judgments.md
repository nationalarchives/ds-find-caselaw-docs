# 12. Enriching existing judgments

Date: 2022-12-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

At some point we'll need to enrich all the documents that are already on MarkLogic but haven't been enriched.

## Decision

Once the full pipeline is up and running, dxw will trickle them into the pipeline
as though they were just regular judgements [via the SNS endpoint]. They are then enriched
as normal, and then pushed back as normal without any changes on the enrichment end.

(This last paragraph seems to imply building something that'll search the database for
unenriched published documents and passing a few of them to enrichment at a time; it's
not yet clear where it should live)

It's also worth considering this when tackling the backlog of judgments not yet on MarkLogic; this will automatically trickle feed in new judgments that are automatically marked as published but bypass the Editor UI and thus won't automatically get enriched on publish. (Or we can flag them up directly as part of the upload process.)

The speed of the enrichment trickle-feed should be controllable: whilst it might take months at one a minute,
we can walk-before-we-run and accelerate that if everything is happy.

## Consequences

We'll have a mechanism for re-enriching the entire corpus if enrichment
substantially changes again in future; we just tweak what it thinks the latest version
should be and it'll slowly trickle everything through again.

Historical judgments have already been processed by vLex; the vLex enrichment would be
removed if the vLex integration is not ready by the time we start processing the existing
judgments. There is work underway to ensure that this is available to us sooner rather
than later.

## Future decisions

We might choose to:

- only send things that have not yet been vCite enriched yet
- reparse documents so that new parser improvements apply to existing documents
